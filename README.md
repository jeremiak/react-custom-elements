# react-custom-elements

A base custom element class that has a `react` inspired API.

## Why?

React is cool. I like to use it in my personal and professional work. But I don't like build processes and I'd _almost_ always prefer a native API to requiring a library.

React's component model is great, and the current custom elements spec left me in somewhat of an uncanny valley where it was similar in some ways to React but not in all of them.

I want to use web components/custom elements but I want them to be a little bit better. I want them to render themselves and use attributes/props and internal state.

## So what is this?

I don't really know, it is mostly a sketch of an idea I had to use DOM native custom elements with the React API I am familiar with.

### Example

For now, take a look in `/examples`. If you want to run the project after downloading/cloning:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`
3. Navigate to the web server and explore the examples

## It doesn't work!

Ya, that seems pretty likely. If you think this, mind opening an issue so we can discuss it? Ultimately, I'd love to just build isolated components in a way that didn't rely on a library from a large tech company and prefer standards.
